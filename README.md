# Hi, I'm Aymeric Nunge

> Recklessly curious software engineer crafting solutions in audio, backend, and machine learning

## Current Adventure

Leading [GANIC SEQUENCER](https://github.com/discordance) - An advanced generative drum sequencer that marries traditional sequencing with deep learning:
- Custom distillated diffusion model (PyTorch)
- High-performance Rust implementation
- 8-track, 32-step sequencer with micro-timing
- Real-time ONNX integration
- Experimental Rust UI frameworks

## Tech Arsenal

```rust
let my_tech_stack = TechStack {
    audio_dsp: vec!["Rust", "C++/JUCE", "Faust", "SuperCollider"],
    cloud_backend: vec!["Rust", "Go", "Python", "PostgreSQL", "Docker", "AWS"],
    frontend: vec!["TypeScript", "React", "WASM"],
    machine_learning: vec!["PyTorch", "NumPy", "SciKit-Learn"],
};
```
